# churn_classifier
Build a classifier to predict whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. This is a binary classification problem.

Most naturally, your audience here would be the telecom business itself, interested in reducing how much money is lost because of customers who don't stick around very long. The question you can ask is: are there any predictable patterns here?


Role of predictive modeling:

 

 

In the targeted approach the company tries to identify in advance customers who are likely to churn. The company then targets those customers with special programs or incentives. This approach can bring in huge loss for a company, if churn predictions are inaccurate, because then firms are wasting incentive money on customers who would have stayed anyway. There are numerous predictive modeling techniques for predicting customer churn. These vary in terms of statistical technique (e.g., neural nets versus logistic regression versus survival analysis), and variable selection method (e.g., theory versus stepwise selection).

 

Objective of this Contest:

 

The objective of this contest is to predict customer churn. We are providing you a public dataset that has customer usage pattern and if the customer has churned or not. We expect you to develop an algorithm to predict the churn score based on usage pattern. The predictors provided are as follows:

account length
international plan
voice mail plan
number of voice mail messages
total day minutes used
day calls made
total day charge
total evening minutes
total evening calls
total evening charge
total night minutes
total night calls
total night charge
total international minutes used
total international calls made
total international charge
number customer service calls made
 

Target Variable:
Churn: if the customer has churned (1=yes; 0 = no)
